# FastDome

FastDome is a set of 3D printed vertices to build a an open source 3d geodesic 2V dome using PVC tubes.

I've used 16cm (outer diameter) PVC tubes. The modeling was done using [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/) and the source can be found under at the `scadÂ´ directory under a GPLv3 license. Use the SCAD file to fit the vertices any diamter tube.

For a 2V geodesic dome we'll need 3 types of vertices:

## Indoor geodesic dome (70cm radius)

For a 70cm radius we'll need 30 A=35cm tubes and 35 B=45cm tubes. The fractions of the diameter are given by 0.54653and 0.61803 respectively.
