# FastDome

An open source 3d geodesic dome (the vertices).

For a 2V geodesic dome we'll need 3 types of vertices:

The modeling was done using [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/) and the source can be found at the 'scad' directory under a GPLv3 license.

## Indoor geodesic dome (70cm radius)

For a 70cm radius we'll need 30 A=35cm tubes and 35 B=45cm tubes. The fractions of the diameter are given by 0.54653and 0.61803 respectively.

A=35cm (x30)

B=45cm (x35)
