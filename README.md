# FastDome

FastDome is a set of 3D printed vertices to build an open source 3d geodesic 2V dome using PVC tubes.

I've used 16cm (outer diameter) PVC tubes. The modeling was done using [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/) and is under a GPLv3 license. Use the SCAD file to fit the vertices any diameter tube.

## Indoor geodesic dome (70cm radius)

(I'll put some math in a couple of days)
For a 70cm radius we'll need 35cm tubes (30) and 45cm tubes (35). I'll put some math here in a couple of days (check the references below).

Have fun!
